/*(SHOULD THIS BE FOLDER TOO? in beta items are just a string, but it makes it less customizable)
maybe we have seperate item types like (material, weapon, key item)
where materials are just strings and counts wheras other items are more like the planets where they have unique feats

maybe items should be a folder to hold a sub folder for weapon data etc
